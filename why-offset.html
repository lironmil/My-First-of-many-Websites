    <h2>A letter from 2011</h2>
    <p>you never have to travel too far to understand that we all knew about the risk of having too much data centers, too much hunger for data. here below is a good example from 2011, and you can be sure the situation only worsend</p>
    <span></span>
         <blockquote>Carbon offset schemes allow individuals and companies to invest in environmental projects around the world in order to balance out their own carbon footprints. The projects are usually based in developing countries and most commonly are designed to reduce future emissions. This might involve rolling out clean energy technologies or purchasing and ripping up carbon credits from an emissions trading scheme. Other schemes work by soaking up CO2 directly from the air through the planting of trees.

Some people and organisations offset their entire carbon footprint while others aim to neutralise the impact of a specific activity, such as taking a flight. To do this, the holidaymaker or business person visits an offset website, uses the online tools to calculate the emissions of their trip, and then pays the offset company to reduce emissions elsewhere in the world by the same amount â€“ thus making the flight "carbon neutral".</blockquote>
